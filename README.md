## Team Members (Alphabetical Order)

## Concept
We wanted to make a 2D co-op platformer based on the theme of Duality. In this game, you have to work together as the forces of Heaven and Hell to get to the end of the level.  
However, if you go too far away from each other, the balance of "Karma" gets disturbed, and you are not able to continue.  
Work together with your partner to stick together while navigating obstacles in this scrolling platformer.
